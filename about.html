				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Greentility is a free web application that allows users to organize all of their monthly expenses.  Users can select what type of Bill they would like to add (e.g. gas, electric, water, etc.).  Next, users can input the data of their individual bills with a month/year and a cost.  After this, each bill in each specific bill category will be graphed to show utility fluctuation throughout the year.</p>
				<p>Greentility was created by Mandy Ryll, a third-year game design student at RIT, and Josh Akers, a third- year Computer Security student at RIT, during RITâ€™s Brick Hack, a 24 hour hackathon!  Greentility is built with extensive javascript, css, and php.</p>
				<p>We hope to continue to work on Greentility to bring users features such as automatic bill updating, data comparison based on other users, location, and time of year.</p>
